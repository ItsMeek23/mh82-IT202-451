6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The only difficulty I had was changing the background to the navigation as<br>I thought inserting the word light-green in the CSS file would allow me<br>to change the background. However after using a color picker, I found the<br>hex decimal for light green which is #C0FFBF which changed the background on<br>the webpage to a light green color. I learned how to implement fill-in<br>boxes and how to change the color of a link when the mouse<br>is hovering over a link.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
